Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation,
Observation is understanding relevant information from an Action's output and Action can be one of three types:
 (1) <search>entity</search>, which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it
     will return some similar entities to search and you can try to search the information from those topics.
 (2) <lookup>keyword</lookup>, which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current context. This only does exact matches,
     so keep your searches short.
 (3) <finish>answer</finish>, which returns the answer and finishes the task.

example1 = """Question
Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?

Thought 1
The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.

Action 1
<search>Milhouse</search>

Observation 1
Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.

Thought 2
The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".

Action 2
<lookup>named after</lookup>

Observation 2
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.

Thought 3
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.

Action 3
<finish>Richard Nixon</finish>

example2 = """Question
What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?

Thought 1
I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.

Action 1
<search>Colorado orogeny</search>

Observation 1
The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.

Thought 2
It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.

Action 2
<lookup>eastern sector</lookup>

Observation 2
The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.

Thought 3
The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.

Action 3
<search>High Plains</search>

Observation 3
High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions

Thought 4
I need to instead search High Plains (United States).

Action 4
<search>High Plains (United States)</search>

Observation 4
The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130m).

Thought 5
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

Action 5
<finish>1,800 to 7,000 ft</finish>
